# 100-Days-of-ML-Code

Came across Siraj Raval 100 Days of ML Code challenge, so decided that I want to try ðŸ˜€ 

Bismillah, hope all goes well and I could be much better in ML! Since I am quite tight on time and in a rush, I may combine some days altogether, also would very much try to do one notebook with a new dataset every day of the challenge. Wish me luck :)

Important points to note in data preprocessing:

1. Handling missing data 
2. Data Reduction
3. Standardize data (Normalization)
4. Handling noisy data
5. Data transformation
